        <h1>HTML Forms</h1>

        <!--To add a form, add <form> tag.-->

        <form>
            <!-- We start with Text Inputs, or should we say Text Boxes.-->
            <label for="username">This is a label for username:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>

            <!-- "type" determines the type of input. We want to put in text so we use the value "text"-->
            <!-- As for "id" and "name", let's just say we will call it as the input's name. Maybe call the textbox as John, you know what I mean.-->
            <!-- Adding the "required" attribute indicates that the field is required.
            If a field is optional, there's no need to add the "required" attribute.-->
            <!-- Notice how we called John or username in the <label> tag. We call him so we can place values for that tag. -->
            
            <!-- To get more what I mean, here are some other examples below.-->
            <!-- Examples include different types of input.-->
            <br>   
            <label for="Jane">This is a label for Jane's email</label>
            <input type="email" id="Jane" name="Jane" required>
            <br>           
            <label for="Doe">This is a label for Doe's password</label>
            <input type="password" id="Doe" name="Doe" required>

            <!-- When you learn Javascript, you'll eventually learn why IDs are essential.-->
            <!-- Notice how the "name" attribute is just there. It acts similarly as ID. -->
            <!-- However, this is used for server-sided purposes. You'll learn it when you pick up node.js-->
            

            <!-- Let's create another form, for Radio Buttons.-->
            <p>Gender</p>
            <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" required> Male <br>
            <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female" required> Female <br>
            <input type="radio" name="gender" value="other" required> Other <br>

            <p>Do you consent getting emails for the newsletter?</p>

            <input type="radio" name="consent" value="yes" required> Yes <br>
            <input type="radio" name="consent" value="no" required> No <br>

            <!-- Radio buttons, when clicked, unchecks the pre-existing one, given if they're on the same "name", if any.-->

            <!-- Ever seen a security question during registration in a certain site? Let's create another form.-->

            <br>

            <label for="security">Security Question</label>

            <select name="security" id="security">
                <option value="q1">What is my favorite game?</option>
                <option value="q2">Who is my favorite game character?</option>
            </select>

            <!-- The select tag is a dropdown filled with choices. Each choice has a value for backend purposes
            as well as the text associated with it. We have two choices, therefore, we need two <option> tags.-->

            <br>

            <label for="securityanswer">Answer:</label>
            <input type="text" id="securityanswer" name="securityanswer" required>

            <!-- What if we want a textbox that can have several lines? <we can go for the <textarea> tag.-->

            <br>
            <label for="bio">Tell me about yourself!</label>
            <br>
            <textarea name="bio" id="bio" cols="30" rows="10" placeholder="Insert text here." required>
            </textarea>

            <!-- "cols" and "rows" attributes determine the size of the text area.
            Placeholders are something you'd see initially in the text area. It disappears when
            you type something in it.-->

            <br>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">

            <!-- Here we have a Submit button. The "value" attribute should contain the words we want to
            put in the button. For instance, we put "Submit".-->
        </form>

    </body>
