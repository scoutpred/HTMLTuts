                <!-- The <span> tag is like a small box that can hold a piece of text, but it doesn't break the flow of the words. -->
                <!--It's useful when you want to style or highlight just a part of the text. -->
                <!-- You can style or highlight specific parts of the text using the <span> tag. -->

                <!-- Notice why one part of the sentence is colored blue? We have what we call "attributes"-->
                <!-- Attributes provide more information within that specified tag. Applicable to most tags.-->
                <!-- For instance, we want to color it blue, so we put in a "style" attribute with the value "color: blue;"-->

                <img src="meme.jpg">
                <!-- Here we have an <img> tag. We need to create a source attribute to show the image-->
                <!-- So we put an "src" attribute followed by an image file.-->
                <img src="pics/jonwaek.jpeg" alt="jon wek">

                <br>

                <!-- If an image file is contained in a folder, simply put the folder name followed by a slash, then an image's exact name and extension.-->
                <img src="jonwaek.jpeg" alt="I can't find the image, but this picture should show an image of jon wek">
                <!-- If the images don't load, there is an alternative text in a form of an "alt" attribute. When hovered, it will show what the image was in text form.-->
